# One-Time-Pads

**One-Time Pads** demonstrates my understanding of Cryptography and Caesar's Algorithm. Caesar cipher involves the replacement of one character for another based on their position (punctuation included). To add more security, One Time Pads (OTP) generates numerous keys that are used to encrypt/decrypt messages. By adding this, one message can have multiple interpretations but only 1 correct translation. Users must specify which OTP to use, in order to encrypt and decrypt the text correctly.

# One-Time-Pads

**Prequisites**
1. Python 3 interpreter
2. Knowledge of Command Line navigation

**Friendly Message**

One-Time Pads demonstrates my understanding of Cryptography and Caesar's Algorithm. Caesar cipher involves the replacement of one character for another based on their position (punctuation included). To add more security, One Time Pads (OTP) generates numerous keys that are used to encrypt/decrypt messages. By adding this, one message can have multiple interpretations but only 1 correct translation. Users must specify which OTP to use, in order to encrypt and decrypt the text correctly.

**Instructions**
1. Download `One Time Pad` script
2. Open `Terminal` and navigate to file
3. Start file by using Python 3: `python3 "One Time Pad".py
4. Program will display a menu asking for command. Please enter number associated with command
5. If this is your first time running or deleted OTP text files, enter `1` for `Generate one-time pads`
6. Enter number of OTP you would like to generate. The more you add, the more secure your text will be
7. When being asked the maximum length of the message, decide on the number of **characters** each message should have
8. Afterwards, you can finally encrypt/decrypt a message. 
9. Please keep in mind which OTP sheet you are using. If not, then your text will be decrypted incorrectly.
